The company is headquatered in Delhi, with several regional offices spread scross the nation. The sales manager faces several challenges in tracking and analysing sales in rapidly growing and dynamic market.

</p>

**Challanges**
1. Lack of real time insights
Sales manager in each region provides individual reports, making it difficult for director to access overall performance.
   
2. Insufficient Reporting Process
The current process involves receiving numerous Excel files each quarter, which makes tracking sales performance time-consuming and inefficient.

<br>

<ins> 2.**Steps Involved** </ins>

<br>

*a. Project planning using AIIMS grid*

-> Purpose - interactive dashboard that enables real time sales insights and support data driven decison making

-> Stakeholder - Market team, Sales director, IT team, Data Analytics team.

-> End result - interactive dashboard providing latest sales insight

-> Success criteria - Dashboard is user friendly, reflects sales insights and helps stakeholders identify trends

<br>

*b. Data discovery and data analysis*


Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in MySQL database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis.

-> IT team provides the Analytics team  with access to MySQL database

-> The analytics team:

   * Inspects tables (Customers, Products, Transactions, Date, Markets)
   * Verifies data integrity by checking for for proper formatting of data, missing or null values.
<br>

*c Data Loading*

-> Established a connection to the MySQL database using Power BI's built-in connector and authenticated using server credentials.

-> Loaded  data into Power BI's data model for building visualizations and performing further analysis.

<br>


*c. Data Cleaning*

-> ***Removed non Indian Markets*** :  Filtered out rows with New York and Paris from the Markets table since the business is focused in India.
```m
= Table.SelectRows(sales_markets, each ([markets_name] <> "New York" and [markets_name] <> "Paris"))**
```
<br>

-> ***Filtered empty rows*** : Removed rows with missing values to maintain data quality.
```m
= Table.SelectRows(sales_markets, each ([zone] <> ""))
```
<br>

-> ***Filtered invalid transactions*** : Excluded records where Transaction Amount <= 0.

```m
= Table.SelectRows(sales_transactions, each ([sales_amount] <> -1 and [sales_amount] <> 0))
```

<br>

-> ***Currency conversion*** : Added a conditional column to convert USD to INR using a defined exchange rate formula.

```m
= Table.SelectRows(#"Removed -1/0", each ([currency] = "INR#(cr)" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)"))

```

<br>

-> ***Add new column normalised_sales_amount***: To normalize all sales amounts to INR for consistent analysis, especially when the dataset includes mixed currencies.

```m
= Table.AddColumn(#"Cleanup currency", "normalised_sales_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount])
```

<br>


*d. Data Modelling*

-> Established relationship between tables.

-> Model established star schema
